								<p>I'm Prajwal, a graduate student at Northeastern University, Boston, MA. I have nearly 3 years of hands-on experience in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Deep learning.</p>

								<p>I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Automobile Engineering from Dayanandasagar College Of Engineering, Bangalore, where I delved into foundational courses such as Data Structures in C and Programming in C.</p>
						
								<p>My professional journey began at Upugo & Surgg Pvt Ltd in Bangalore. During my time there, I was involved in the development of foundational features of the platform, including an end-to-end pipeline for pose estimation and a personalized workout recommendation system.</p>

								<p>Building on my industry experience, I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University, Khoury College Of Computer Sciences, Boston. I am expected to graduate in 2025. I'm currently a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the Foundations of Artificial Intelligence course (CS5100), where I collaborate with the professor to work on autograders and provide valuable support to students during recitations and teaching hours.</p>
						
								<p>I recently completed my co-op as a Software Engineer at Akamai from July - December 2024. Here, I worked on the Cloud Native Services team. My main area of work involved contributing new features to Linode's Cluster API and their Container Storage Interface(CSI) Driver.</p>
								
								<p>With a comprehensive background in both academia and industry, I'm excited about the intersection of AI with various technologies and eager to contribute to innovative solutions in this dynamic field.</p>
