								<p>I'm Prajwal, a Deep Learning and Computer Vision Engineer with nearly 3 years of hands-on experience in developing and deploying models. My academic journey laid the foundation for my expertise, and I continue to explore the cutting-edge intersections of AI and computer vision.</p>
						
								<p>I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Automobile Engineering from Dayanandasagar College Of Engineering, Bangalore, where I delved into foundational courses such as Data Structures in C and Programming in C. During this time, I developed a strong programming background, setting the stage for my future in AI.</p>
						
								<p>My professional journey began at Upugo & Surgg Pvt Ltd in Bangalore, where I served as the Lead Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence Engineer. Here, I successfully implemented cutting-edge technologies, such as an end-to-end pipeline for pose estimation and a PyTorch-based recommendation system for personalized workout plans. Additionally, I orchestrated the deployment of an AWS-based distributed system, optimizing scalability and resource efficiency.</p>

								<p>Building on my industry experience, I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University, Khoury College Of Computer Sciences, Boston. I am expected to graduate in 2025, and my coursework so-far includes topics such as Foundations of Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Programming Design Paradigm and Algorithms. My academic journey is complemented by hands-on involvement beyond the classroom. As a Graduate Teaching Assistant, I actively contribute to the Foundations of Artificial Intelligence course (CS5100), where I collaborate with the professor to design course content and provide valuable support to students during recitations and office hours.</p>
						
								<p>I'm also contributing as a Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance in the DROVER project at Aerospace NUAV, Northeastern University's drone club. In this role, I leverage my expertise in computer vision to advance UAV technology, contributing to the dynamic and innovative initiatives of the club.</p>
								
								<p>With a comprehensive background in both academia and industry, I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible in computer vision and AI. I am excited about the intersection of AI with various technologies and I'm eager to contribute to innovative solutions in this dynamic field.</p>
